        ngbPopover="My driven, kind, and beautiful 23 year old cousin, Ashley, was rushed to the hospital by her boyfriend, after he found her having an unexpected seizure. After several tests, the doctors found that she had a tumor on her brain. She had her first brain surgery on July 1, 2020. We were all stunned when the doctors shared the results that the tumor was a Grade 3 malignant (cancer) tumor. Since then, my family has been doing immense amounts of research. They have learned that she will need to have a second brain surgery, in which they will remove as much of the tumor as they can do safely, and then subsequent Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy to destroy as many cancerous tumor tissues that are left without causing any permanent damage to the brain. After many interviews with talented and qualified neuro-surgeons and neuro-oncologists, Ashley determined that Northwestern University is the right place for her surgery. Dr. Matthew Tate will be performing the surgery and Dr Rimas Lukas will coordinate her ongoing treatments.  Both doctors have helped set today’s standards for brain tumor care and are leaders in pushing the field forward. 

        Ashley will be in good hands." popoverTitle="Ashley's Story">
